Switching to Yao is easy. Yao focuses on generative programming. It may take time to learn a few key concepts, but once you understand them, you’ll see that Yao is a powerful tool. It helps you build applications faster and offers a great development experience.

The following sections will help you understand the core concepts of Yao and how to use them to build applications.

## Generative Programming

Before the AGI era, we believe the best way to work with AI is as a collaborator, not a master.

We aim to make generated code match hand-written code, easy to read and modify, so developers and machines can collaborate seamlessly.

- **For Human**: We want the code to be easy to read and write, clear, and intuitive.
- **For Machine**: We aim to make the code AI-friendly, easy to generate, and simple to extend.

In Yao, we use a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to describe widgets, assemble them into applications, and use processes for atomic functions.

Yao widget could be a Table, Form, List, or Chart. It could also be a Data Model, API, Store, Flow, etc.

Yao DSL is an intermediate language understandable by both humans and machines. It can be generated by AI, created via GUI, or written manually, with seamless switching between approaches.

Use the Yao runtime to execute the code, and its built-in HTTP server to serve the application.

## Yao Application

A Yao application is a collection of widget DSLs and custom processes written in TypeScript or JavaScript.

For websites, the SUI template engine (new in version 0.10.4) can help you build the web pages you need.

Each widget type has its own directory in the project root, such as `models`, `tables`, `forms`, `apis`, `etc`.

The DSL source files are named in lowercase with the `.[TYPE].yao` extension, for example, `article.mod.yao`.

Custom process files are lowercase in the `scripts` directory, e.g., `article.ts`. The process name is `scripts.article.[FUNCTION_NAME]`.

### Directory Structure

The yao application directory structure is as follows:

```bash
app
├── aigcs # AIGC Widgets: use the prompt as a process
├── apis  # API Widgets: define the REST API
├── app.yao # Application Configuration
├── charts # Chart Widgets: chart-type pages in the admin panel
├── connectors  # AI Connectors, Database Connectors, Redis Connectors, etc.
├── dashboards  # Dashboard Widgets: dashboard-type pages in the admin panel
├── data    # The default application data directory, use the File System Process or JSAPI to access. Custom data directory can be set in environment variables.
├── db      # The sqlite database directory, the default option of database. If use another database, this directory is not necessary.
├── flows   # Flow Widgets: define the process flow
├── forms   # Form Widgets: form-type pages in the admin panel
├── icons   # The application icons used in the admin panel
├── langs   # I18n language files used in the admin panel
├── logins  # Login Widgets: login-type pages in the admin panel
├── logs    # The application log directory, the default option of log. Custom log directory can be set in environment variables.
├── models  # Model Widgets: define the data structure
├── neo     # The AI Chatbot configuration directory
├── plugins # The Default GRPC plugins directory, Custom plugins directory can be set in environment variables.
├── public  # The static files directory, can be accessed via the HTTP server. SUI template engine generates the web pages here too.
├── scripts # Custom Process: write the custom process in TypeScript or JavaScript
├── tables  # Table Widgets: table-type pages in the admin panel
└── ....    # Other widget types, or your self-defined widget types
```

### Yao Widget

A Widget in Yao is not just a traditional frontend component; it is a combination of UI, interaction, logic, and data. There are no frontend and backend concepts in a Widget; it is a self-contained unit.

A widget could be a Table, Form, List, or Chart. It could also be a Data Model, API, Store, Flow, etc.

Each Widget has a set of Processes, and some Widgets have a set of REST APIs. It can be used in other widgets, custom processes, or integrated into other applications.

A Widget is described using DSL, which is in JSON format. It can be generated by AI, created via a GUI, or written manually. Such as:

#### Model DSL

Model Widget is used to describe the data structure, it same as the database table schema.

The Model DSL contains a set of processes to operate on the data, such as CRUD, Query, etc. You can use it directly.

```json
// Model DSL
{
  "name": "Article",
  "table": { "name": "article", "comment": "Article" },
  "columns": [
    { "name": "id", "comment": "ID", "type": "ID", "label": "ID" },
    { "label": "Title", "name": "title", "type": "string" },
    { "label": "Summary", "name": "summary", "type": "string" }
  ]
}
```

```bash
# Use the process to find the data
yao run models.article.Find 1 '::{}'
```

#### Table Widget

Table Widget is used to display the data in a admin panel. bind to the Model Widget, automatically generate the basic CRUD operations.

The Table DSL contains a set of processes and REST APIs to operate on the data, such as Find, Search etc. You can use it directly.

```json
// Table DSL
{
  "name": "Articles",
  "action": {
    "bind": { "model": "article", "option": { "form": "article" } }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Use the process to search the data
yao run yao.tables.Search article '::{}' 1 10
```

```bash
# Use the REST API to search the data
curl --request GET \
  --url https://127.0.0.1:5099/api/__yao/table/article/search \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer your_token_here'
```
