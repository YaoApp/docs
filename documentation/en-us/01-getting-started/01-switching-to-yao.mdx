Switching to Yao is easy. Yao focuses on generative development. It may take time to learn a few key concepts, but once you understand them, you’ll see that Yao is a powerful tool. It helps you build applications faster and offers a great development experience.

The following sections will help you understand the core concepts of Yao and how to use them to build applications.

## Generative Programming

Before the AGI era, we believe that the best way to work with AI is to make it a collaborator, not a master.

We aim to make generated code match hand-written code, easy to read and modify, so developers and machines can collaborate seamlessly.

- **For Human**: We want to make the code human-readable, easy to write, and easy to understand.
- **For Machine**: We want to make the code AI-friendly, easy to generate, and easy to extend.

In Yao, we use a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) to describe widgets, combine multiple widgets into an application, and use processes to implement atomic functions.

Yao DSL is an intermediate language understandable by both humans and machines. It can be generated by AI, created via GUI, or written manually, with seamless switching between approaches.

### Yao Widget

A Widget in Yao is not just a traditional frontend component; it is a combination of UI, interaction, logic, and data. There are no frontend and backend concepts in a Widget; it is a self-contained unit.

A widget could be a Table, Form, List, or Chart. It could also be a Data Model, API, Store, Flow, etc.

Each Widget has a set of Processes, and some Widgets have a set of REST APIs. It can be used in other widgets, custom processes, or integrated into other applications.

A Widget is described using DSL, which is in JSON format. It can be generated by AI, created via a GUI, or written manually. Such as:

#### Model DSL

Model Widget is used to describe the data structure, it same as the database table schema.

The Model DSL contains a set of processes to operate on the data, such as CRUD, Query, etc. You can use it directly.

```json
// Model DSL
{
  "name": "Article",
  "table": { "name": "article", "comment": "Article" },
  "columns": [
    { "name": "id", "comment": "ID", "type": "ID", "label": "ID" },
    { "label": "Title", "name": "title", "type": "string" },
    { "label": "Summary", "name": "summary", "type": "string" }
  ]
}
```

```bash
# Use the process to find the data
yao run models.article.Find 1 '::{}'
```

#### Table Widget

Table Widget is used to display the data in a admin panel. bind to the Model Widget, automatically generate the basic CRUD operations.

The Table DSL contains a set of processes and REST APIs to operate on the data, such as Find, Search etc. You can use it directly.

```json
// Table DSL
{
  "name": "Articles",
  "action": {
    "bind": { "model": "article", "option": { "form": "article" } }
  }
}
```

```bash
# Use the process to search the data
yao run yao.tables.Search article '::{}' 1 10
```

```bash
# Use the REST API to search the data
curl --request GET \
  --url https://127.0.0.1:5099/api/__yao/table/article/search \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer your_token_here'
```
