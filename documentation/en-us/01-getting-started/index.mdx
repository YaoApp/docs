Welcome to the Yao documentation!

## What is Yao?

Yao is an **all-in-one application engine** that enables developers to create web apps, REST APIs, enterprise apps, and more, with AI as a seamless collaborator.

### Generative Development

Generative Development is the core of Yao. It means that you can generate code using AI models, GUI, or by writing code. The Yao DSL is designed to be **human-readable**, easy to write, **AI-friendly**, and easily extendable.

### All-in-one App Engine

Yao has a built-in suite of tools essential for application development, such as:

- **TS/JS/DSL Runtime**: A runtime that can directly run TypeScript, JavaScript, and DSL code.
- **HTTP Server**: A powerful HTTP server that can handle any HTTP request, for REST APIs, web pages, etc.
- **Process Engine**: Hundreds of processes that cover the needs of over 90% of applications.
- **UI Components**: UI components that support AI-powered inputs and can be used in DSL code with simple syntax to build dashboards, admin panels, and more.
- **Template Engine**: A component-based template engine that can generate any web page.
- **AI Connector**: A connector that integrates AI models for use within your application.
- **Database**: A powerful ORM for database interactions.
- **File System**: A virtual file system that can store various types of data.

More features can be found in the **[Why-Yao document](getting-started/why-yao)**.

All these features are packaged into a single binary with no package or toolchain dependencies. **Just download and run it to start building your application.**

Yao can bring you a whole new development experience, increasing your development efficiency by several times.
