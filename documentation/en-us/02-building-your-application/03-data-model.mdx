Starting from this section, we'll build a simple pet store application together, demonstrating how to use Yao effectively. You will learn how to:

- üîµ **Create and manage data in your application.**
- ‚ö™ Develop RESTful APIs to expose data. üëâ [REST API](rest-api)
- ‚ö™ Design web pages to display data. üëâ [Web Page](web-page)
- ‚ö™ Build an admin panel to help administrators of the pet store manage data. üëâ [Admin Panel](admin-panel)
- ‚ö™ Create backend commands for task scheduling. üëâ [CLI](cli)
- ‚ö™ Integrate AI for chatbots, image generation, and enhanced user input. üëâ [AI Integration](ai-integration)

Ensure you have read the previous documentation, to understand the basic concepts of Yao.

## Data Model Overview

Data models are blueprints for defining the structure of your data and are the most important part of a Yao application.

In Yao, the Data Model is a widget that uses Model DSL to describe your data's structure, similar to a database schema. Understanding database structures and relationships will help you design your data model effectively.

For more details about Model DSL, see üëâ **[DSL References](references/dsl)**

## Step 1: Plan Your Data Structure

Before creating a data model, you should plan the structure of your data. The best way is to let an AI chatbot assist you.

**Open an AI Chatbot and ask for help to generate data structure for your application.**

**üí¨ Prompts for planning data structure**

_This is an example of a conversation with an AI chatbot to plan the data structure for a pet store application. Change the prompts according to your requirements._

````yaml
- I want to create a pet store application.
- The functionality includes adding, updating, and deleting pets, pet's categories and goods in the store.
- Help me design the data structure, Please provide me with a list of data tables and their fields.
- Reply to me with the table name, field name, and field type for each table.
- Table and field names should be in snake_case, Auto-increment fields should be named as `id`, wrapped in code blocks.
- For example:
```plaintext
Table: pet_categories
    - id: INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
    - category_name: VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - description: TEXT
```
````

**ü§ñ _Reply from AI Chatbot_**

```plaintext
Table: pet_categories
    - id: INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
    - category_name: VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - description: TEXT

Table: pets
    - id: INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
    - pet_name: VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - category_id: INT NOT NULL
    - age: INT
    - breed: VARCHAR(255)
    - description: TEXT
    - FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES pet_categories(id)

Table: goods
    - id: INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
    - good_name: VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    - category_id: INT NOT NULL
    - price: DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
    - stock_quantity: INT NOT NULL
    - description: TEXT
    - FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES pet_categories(id)

Table: transactions
    - id: INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT
    - pet_id: INT
    - good_id: INT
    - transaction_date: DATETIME NOT NULL
    - quantity: INT NOT NULL
    - total_price: DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
    - FOREIGN KEY (pet_id) REFERENCES pets(id)
    - FOREIGN KEY (good_id) REFERENCES goods(id)

Explanation:
    pet_categories: This table stores the various categories of pets and goods available in the store.
    pets: This table keeps track of the pets available in the store, including their name, age, breed, and category.
    goods: This table records the goods available for purchase, including their name, price, stock quantity, and associated category.
    transactions: This table logs transactions involving pets and goods, including the date, quantity, and total price.
```

## Step 2: Generate Model DSL

With your data structure planned, you can now generate the Model DSL for your application.

Send your data structure and one or more existing Model DSL examples to the chatbot, and ask for help in generating similar Model DSLs.

You can get the existing Model DSL examples from the Yao documentation or other public repositories. in this case, we will use the article model from the Yao website repository.

üëâ [Article Model DSL](https://github.com/YaoApp/yao-website/blob/main/models/article.mod.yao)

**üí¨ Prompts for Generating Model DSL**

_This is an example of a conversation with an AI chatbot to generate Model DSL for a pet store application. Change the prompts according to your requirements._

```yaml
Model DSL Samples:
[Model DSL Samples]

Structure Planned:
[Structure Planned (The response from the AI chatbot in the previous step)]

- According to the planned structure, I need help generating Model DSL for the pet store application.
- Please provide me the Model DSL like the example provided.
- Each Model DSL should be wrapped in a code block.
```

**ü§ñ _Reply from AI Chatbot_**

The AI chatbot will generate the Model DSL for each table based on the provided structure.

It looks like this:

```json
// Model DSL for pet_categories
{
  "name": "PetCategory",
  "table": { "name": "pet_categories", "comment": "Pet Categories" },
  "columns": [
    { "name": "id", "comment": "ID", "type": "ID", "label": "ID" },
    {
      "label": "Category Name",
      "name": "category_name",
      "comment": "Name of the pet category",
      "type": "string",
      "length": 255,
      "nullable": false
    },
    {
      "label": "Description",
      "name": "description",
      "comment": "Description of the pet category",
      "type": "text",
      "nullable": true
    }
  ],
  "option": { "timestamps": true }
}
// ....
```

**üìù Notes:**

You can improve the prompts and Generate Model DSL directly. In this example, steps are separated for better understanding.

**üí¨ Prompts for Generating Model DSL Directly**

Following the next prompts, you can generate Model DSL directly.

```yaml
Model DSL Samples:
[Model DSL Samples]

- I want to create a pet store application.
- The functionality includes adding, updating, and deleting pets, pet's categories and goods in the store.
- Help me design the data structure for the pet store application.
- According to the planned structure, I need help generating Model DSL for the pet store application.
- Please provide me the Model DSL like the example provided.
- Each Model DSL should be wrapped in a code block.
```

**ü™Ñ Add More Promts**

Adding more prompts helps generate better Model DSLs. The more information you provide, the better the AI chatbot can understand your needs.

For example, describe your business to the AI chatbot, and it will generate more tailored Model DSLs for you.

## Step 3: Save Model DSLs
