In this section, we'll use the Simple User Interface (SUI) to build a dynamic web page displaying data from your application.

SUI is a built-in component-based template engine using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to create web pages. It's AI-friendly, supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and requires no additional build tools.

## Overview

SUI, a new feature in Yao v0.10.4, is AI-friendly and streamlines web page creation and data integration. It supports backward compatibility, enabling developers to use HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript while promoting code reusability with a component-based architecture.

SUI requires no additional build tools and naturally supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), enhancing SEO and making it suitable for web development.

**_Note: SUI is a new feature and still experimental. For advanced frontend requirements, consider using frameworks like React or Vue. Place the built files in the `public` directory and connect them to Yao via REST API._**
