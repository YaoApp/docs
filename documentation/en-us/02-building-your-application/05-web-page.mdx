In this section, we'll use the Simple User Interface (SUI) to build a dynamic web page displaying data from your application.

SUI is a built-in component-based template engine using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to create web pages. It's AI-friendly, supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and requires no additional build tools.

## Overview

SUI, a new feature in Yao v0.10.4, is AI-friendly and streamlines web page creation and data integration. It supports backward compatibility, enabling developers to use HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript while promoting code reusability with a component-based architecture.

SUI requires no additional build tools and naturally supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), enhancing SEO and making it suitable for website development.

**_Note: SUI is a new feature and still experimental. For advanced frontend requirements, consider using frameworks like React or Vue. Place the built files in the `public` directory and connect them to Yao via REST API._**

## Step 1: Generate Web Page

In this demo, we'll create two web pages: one to list pets and another for pet details.

The AI-generated web pages are suitable for a simple website, and you can further customize them by editing the generated content.

This step demonstrates how to write prompts to generate web pages.

**ðŸ’¬ Prompts for Generating Web Pages**

_This is an example of a conversation with an AI chatbot to generate web pages. Change the prompts according to your requirements._

````yaml
Model Samples:
[Model Samples]

Related Models:
    pets, pet.categories

Guidelines for Generating Web Pages:
  - Each web page should consist of separate Pure HTML, CSS, and TypeScript files. Use the same name with different extensions (e.g., index.html, index.css, index.ts).
  - Avoid using frameworks or libraries. If necessary, import libraries via the script tag.
  - The rendering logic will be handled by the Template Engine, so you don't need to implement it. Use the JS file for animations.
  - For third-party libraries, include the CDN link in the JS file using `import '<CDN link>';`.
  - HTML content should exclude the <head> and <body> tags; these are added by the SUI engine.
  - Separate Common CSS files for consistent styling, If necessary, import them into the CSS file using `import '@assets/[name].css';`.
  - For consistency, use the same CSS class names and IDs as the model fields.
  - Each file should be wrapped in a code block, with the file name commented at the top.

Template Engine Rules:
  - Use `{{ variable }}` syntax for data rendering within HTML tags.
  - Use `s:for` for looping over data lists, e.g., `<div s:for="items" s:for-item="pet"> <span>{{ pet.name }}</span> </div>`.
  - Use `s:if` for conditional rendering, e.g., `<span s:if="pet.name">{{ pet.name }}</span>`.
  - File system routes define web page routes. For example, `index.html` maps to '/', 'about.html' maps to '/about'.
  - Dynamic routes are represented by `[id]`, e.g., '/pet/1', '/pet/2' is '/[id]'.
  - Use `s:on-click` for event binding, e.g., `<button s:on-click="handleClick" s:data-id="{{ pet.id }}">Click</button>`.
  - Implement event handlers in the TS/JS file, e.g.:

    ```typescript
    import { EventData, Component, EventDetail } from "@yao/sui";
    const self = this as Component;

    self.handleClick = (event: Event, data: EventData, detail: EventDetail) => {
        // handle the event
        // data['id'] corresponds to s:data-id="{{ pet.id }}"
    };
    ```

Web Page Requirements:
  - Use the fields in the model to generate web page content.
  - Create two pages: 'index' to list pets and '[id]' for pet details, where 'id' is the pet's ID.
  - Display the pet category name on the list page using the pet.categories model.
  - Separate Common CSS file style.css for consistent styling, define the Common font, color, and spacing in the CSS file.
  - Maintain consistent styles and implement animations and interactive JS effects.

**ðŸ¤– _Reply from AI Chatbot_**

The AI chatbot will generate web pages for you, It should be like this:

```html
<!-- [id].html -->
<div class="pet-details">
  <h1>{{ pet.pet_name }}</h1>
  <p>Category: {{ pet.category_name }}</p>
  <p s:if="pet.age">Age: {{ pet.age }}</p>
  <p s:if="pet.breed">Breed: {{ pet.breed }}</p>
  <p s:if="pet.description">{{ pet.description }}</p>
  <button s:on-click="goBack">Back to List</button>
</div>
```

```css
/* [id].css */
@import "@assets/style.css";

.pet-details {
  padding: 24px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 8px;
}

button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #0056b3;
}
```

```typescript
// [id].ts
import { EventData, Component, EventDetail } from "@yao/sui";
const self = this as Component;

self.goBack = () => {
  window.location.href = `/`;
};
```
