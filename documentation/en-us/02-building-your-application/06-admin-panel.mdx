## Overview

Building an admin panel with Yao is quick and easy.

Use widgets like Table, Form, Dashboard, etc., to create a complete admin panel in minutes.

These widgets provide RESTful APIs. The frontend uses React and communicates with the backend through these APIs. The distribution files are in the Yao executable.

Before the HTTP server starts, Yao converts DSLs into RESTful APIs, serving both APIs and static files.

For a custom admin panel, use the RESTful APIs to build your own frontend and place the distribution files in the `public` directory. ðŸ‘‰ [Building your component library](../using-source-code/building-your-component-library)

In this demo, we use the Table and Form widgets to create an admin panel for the pet store administrator to manage data.
