It’s time to launch your application!

This section will guide you through the deployment process. You can choose to deploy your application to a server with Yao installed or run it in a Docker container.

## Overview

For self-hosted deployment, you can choose from the following options:

- 👉 [Yao Server](#yao-server): Deploy to a server with Yao installed.
- 👉 [Docker Container](#docker-container): Build a Docker image and run it in a container.

_We're planning on offering hosting services, but they're not available just yet. Once available, you'll be able to use `yao deploy` to deploy your application to our cloud service. If you're excited about hosting, let us know! We'll prioritize bringing this feature to you. 🤝 [Join us on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BkMR2NUsjU)_
