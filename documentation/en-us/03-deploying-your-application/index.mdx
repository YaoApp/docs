It’s time to launch your application!

This section will guide you through the deployment process. You can choose to deploy your application to a server with Yao installed or run it in a Docker container.

## Overview

For self-hosted deployment, you can choose from the following options:

- 👉 [Yao Server](#yao-server): Deploy to a server with Yao installed.
- 👉 [Docker Container](#docker-container): Build a Docker image and run it in a container.

_We're planning on offering hosting services, but they're not available just yet. Once available, you'll be able to use `yao deploy` to deploy your application to our cloud service. If you're excited about hosting, let us know! We'll prioritize bringing this feature to you. 🤝 [Join us on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BkMR2NUsjU)_

## Yao Server

The Yao server is a server with Yao installed. You can deploy your application to the server and run it.

### Step 1: Install Yao

First, you need to install Yao on the server. You can follow the 👉 [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation) to install Yao.

### Step 2: Upload Your Application

Next, you need to upload your application source code to the server.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/application
scp -r . user@server:/path/to/destination
```

### Step 3: Configure Your Application

Modify the .env file on the server to configure your application. 👉 [App Configuration](../building-your-application/app-configuration#environment-variables)

Example:

```bash
YAO_ENV=production
YAO_DB_DRIVER="mysql"
YAO_DB_PRIMARY="webuser:webpass@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/website?charset=utf8mb4&parseTime=True&loc=Local"
```

**📜 Tips**:

1. Prepare two env files, one for development and one for production, copy the production env file to the server and rename it to .env
2. Use `yao inspect` to check the configuration of your application. `cd /path/to/your/application && yao inspect`
3. For production use, make sure to set `YAO_ENV=production` in the .env file, It reduces the log output and improves performance.

### Step 4: Migration

The first time you deploy your application or data model changes, you need to use the `yao migrate` command to migrate the database.

`yao migrate` will detect the changes in the data model and apply them to the database. If you need to reset the database, you can use the `--reset` flag.

**❗Migrate command is a dangerous operation, make sure to backup your database before running it.**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/application

# Migrate command is a dangerous operation, make sure to backup your database before running it.
yao migrate --force
```

> _Run other custom processes to prepare your application, such as seeding data, after the migration is complete, if necessary._

### Step 5: Start Your Application

After the migration is complete, you can start your application.

Use [nohup](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nohup.1p.html) to start your application in the background.

```bash
# Start your application in the background
cd /path/to/your/application && nohup yao start >> /path/to/your/application/yao.log 2>&1 &
```

**❗Recommended: Use PM2 or a similar process manager to manage the yao start process for improved reliability and uptime.**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/application

# start your application with pm2
pm2 start "yao start" --name yao-app

# Check list of running applications
pm2 list

# Check logs
pm2 logs yao-app
```
